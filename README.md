# Unit-2-Business-Project

## Introduction

* In this specific project, I was tasked to create a business that would improve my community. With the use of multiple different classes, mutator methods, and constructors, I was able to create my own Build-A-Bear shop.

## Reflection
1. Describe Your Project
   * My project was created from scratch. It consits of one super class, and two differen subclasses. Each subclass inherited the type of bear, type of material bear, and pric of the bear. One class focused on constructing our own bear. While the other class consisted of dressing the bear up.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?
   * Although my projct consists of multply milestones, the top two key elements in my code would have to be the way I was able to create a toString method, mostly because it took me various days to finally understand it's function. I am also proud that I was debug the entire thing on my own, which is impressive since there were like 100 errors.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.
   * Personally, if given the opporutnity, I would go back and implement user imput. This would allow the user to input their own desired bear, whether or not they want a costume, a heart, etc.
